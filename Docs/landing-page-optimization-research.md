## Recommended Landing Page Sections

### 1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)

The hero section is the most critical element—it's the first thing visitors see and determines whether they scroll further.

**Must Include:**
- Compelling headline that communicates the value proposition
- Subheadline explaining what the pack contains
- Primary CTA button (e.g., "Download Now" or "Get the Pack")
- Hero image showing the best assets from the collection
- Optional: Secondary CTA (e.g., "View Gallery")

**Best Practices:**
- Keep it clean with strategic whitespace
- Ensure the CTA is immediately visible without scrolling
- Use high-contrast colors for the primary button
- Mobile optimization is critical—hero must work on all screen sizes

### 2. Visual Gallery / Asset Showcase

For vector asset packs, visuals are everything. Buyers want to see exactly what they're getting.

**Recommended Approaches:**
- **Masonry grid** showing individual assets
- **Context mockups** showing assets in real-world use (posters, websites, social media)
- **Interactive preview** allowing users to zoom or hover for details
- **Before/after comparisons** showing assets integrated into designs

**File Format Display:**
Show available formats prominently (AI, EPS, SVG, PNG) as this affects purchase decisions.

### 3. What's Included Section

Create a clear inventory of the pack contents.

**Display:**
- Total asset count (e.g., "150+ Hand-Crafted Elements")
- Category breakdown (scissors, paper, glue, rulers, pencils, etc.)
- File formats included
- Resolution/quality specs
- Bonus items if any

**Visual Treatment:**
Use icons or small previews alongside each category for scannability.

### 4. Use Cases Section

Show potential buyers how they can use the assets.

**Suggested Use Cases for Papercraft Pack:**
- Educational materials and worksheets
- Craft blog graphics
- Social media posts for DIY/craft accounts
- Scrapbooking digital elements
- Teacher resources and classroom decor
- Etsy shop graphics
- Children's book illustrations
- Packaging design for craft products

**Format:**
Grid of mockups or carousel showing assets in context.

### 5. Social Proof Section

Testimonials increase conversions by up to 34%.

**Elements to Include:**
- Customer testimonials with photos/names
- Download count or "X designers trust this pack"
- Star ratings if available
- Logos of companies/brands that have used the assets
- Featured in badges (if applicable)

**Placement:**
Integrate social proof throughout the page, not just in one dedicated section. Add star ratings near the hero, testimonials mid-page, and trust badges near CTAs.

### 6. Pricing / License Section

Clear, transparent pricing is essential.

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Sweet spot for digital products: $27-$97
- Consider tiered pricing:
  - **Personal License** ($29-39): Individual use only
  - **Commercial License** ($49-79): Business/client use
  - **Extended/Team License** ($99+): Unlimited use, team access

**License Clarity:**
Explicitly state what each license allows to reduce friction and support inquiries.

### 7. FAQ Section

Address common objections and questions.

**Suggested FAQs:**
- What file formats are included?
- Can I use these for commercial projects?
- Do I get free updates?
- What software do I need?
- Is there a refund policy?
- How do I download after purchase?

### 8. Final CTA Section

- Large, prominent CTA button
- Risk reversal (money-back guarantee)
- Quick summary of what's included
